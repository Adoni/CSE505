Logic Tensor Networks
====

This is a project of course [CSE 505](http://www3.cs.stonybrook.edu/~pfodor/courses/cse505.html) in Stony Brook University.

The project is based on paper [Logic Tensor Networks: Deep Learning and Logical
Reasoning from Data and Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.04422.pdf), which proposed a neural network model to construct logical system.

In this project, we have the following distribution:

* We implement their model;
* We proposed a new structure named Convolutional Logic Tensor Networks (C-LTN), which gets better performance in the "friends and smoker" example;
* We design several experiments to illustrate the performance of logical system implementation with tensor networks.
