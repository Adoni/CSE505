\section{Related Work}
Here we try to compare LTN with some other models which try to combine learning and logical reasoning together.

        \toprule
        Model X & Feature of Model X  & Feature of LTN \\
        \midrule
        Markov Logic \newline Network
        &
        -The level of truth of a formula depends on the number of models that satisfy the formula

        -Works under the closed world assumption
        &
        -The level of truth of a complex formula is -determined by (fuzzy) logical reasoning

        -Works under open domain
        \\
        \midrule
        Bayesian Logic
        &
        Explicit probabilistic approach
        &
        Take the benefits of tensor networks for computational efficiency.

        Knowledge \newline Embedding
        &
        -Function-free langauges

        -A special case of LTN

        -The semantics of the universal and existential quantifiers is based on the closed-world assumption (CWA)

        &
        -Provide groundings for functional symbols

        -A General model

        -Does not make the CWA

        -No specific t-norm
