\section{Related Work}

As described in the original paper \cite{serafini2016logic}, there are several models which are similar to LTN. All of them try to combine learning and logical reasoning together.

To avoid unnecessary details, here we try to compare LTN with some other models by listing the most important different features in Table \ref{tab:compare}. It seems that LTN combines the advantages of those models, which gives some confidence about the power of this model.
