\section{Experiments}

This section will explore the same example given by the original paper, which is called ``friends and smokers'' problem. We will firstly how the definition of this example respect to the symbols we use before. Then two experiments will be deducted on knowledge base with only observed facts and knowledge base with extra rules. Finally, we will show the effects of vector length.

The experiments details are as following: total training epoch is 1000 and choose the best one according to the accuracy; for the 3.2 and 3.3, the vector length is 50.
