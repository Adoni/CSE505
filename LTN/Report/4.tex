\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we gives a overview of paper ``Logic Tensor Networks: Deep Learning and Logical Reasoning from Data and Knowledge'' \cite{serafini2016logic}.
Besides implementing the original LTN model, we also proposed a kind of variation for LTN, called Convolutional LTN (C-LTN). Experiments ``smoker and friends'' example shows that C-LTN is not only easy to train, but also preforms better when fitting the data and learning from rules.
